When brainstorming for this project, we drew inspiration from our own academic experiences 
and the disparities we saw in underfunded schools. Lacking extensive resources for labs, much of our scientific exploration involved 
jotting down notes to help us answer questions. As we reflected on our early education, we realized that doubts about our scientific
abilities often drove us away from STEM at a young age. With that in mind, we decided to create something that would allow 
students from backgrounds like ours to engage in scientific experiments both inside and outside the classroom. Our website, once fully developed,
aims to provide interactive exercises simulating common labs found in fundamental schooling.

What it Does:

The website offers interactive lab simulations for science students, covering topics in physics, chemistry, and astronomy. 
Students can select subjects and specific labs to engage with, participating in step-by-step animated simulations that allow them to experiment with scientific principles.
For example, they can manipulate variables like temperature or pressure and observe real-time changes, helping them understand concepts like buoyancy, states of matter, or orbital movement.

How We Built It:

As beginner coders, we chose Python as our primary programming language.
We used libraries like Pygame, sys, and math to handle processes that were beyond our knowledge, creating fun animations to represent each lab topic.
Once the code was complete, we converted it to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using an online code converter. For the website visuals, we used Visual Studio Code and incorporated a template from Flatlogic to design a simple,
beginner-friendly website front.
